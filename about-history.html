                                Based in Branson, Missouri, Myer Hospitality is one of the reasons the area is
                                well-known as a great family vacation destination: family owned businesses. The Myer
                                family is successful in one of Branson’s largest industries, lodging.  Carroll and
                                Janice Myer, founders of Myer Hotels, began a hotel career in 1967 when they purchased
                                their first motel in O’Neill, Nebraska. For the next several years they learned about
                                the lodging business before selling the motel and returning to Iowa to continue farming.
                                That change didn’t last long.

                                In 1972, Carroll and Janice bought their first property in Branson, the Branson Motor
                                Court. The motel remains today in much the same fashion it did then. The motel was sold.
                                 The family moved and purchased an independent motel in Rolla, MO. The Myer family
                                continued to develop in the motel business with a move to Julesburg, Colorado where they
                                owned a Best Western, their first branded hotel. Drawn back to the Ozarks, they moved to
                                Arkansas in 1976

                                    Carroll had a goal of owning a 100-unit property. He succeeded when they purchased a
                                    100-unit Ramada Inn in Harrison, Arkansas. With a commitment to quality, cleanliness
                                    and overall excellence, in 1978 the Myer’s Ramada was named the best Ramada Inn in
                                    the country. The family owned the property for 12 years, during which time numerous
                                    stars visited, including the King of Rock-N-Roll himself, Elvis Presley.

                                Carroll and Janice Myer were helped by their three sons who grew up learning the lodging
                                business. Other hotels were purchased in Mountain Home and Fayetteville, Arkansas.
                                Despite their success in Arkansas, something continued to pull the family toward
                                Branson.
                                In the early 80s, Carroll and Janice purchased the Best Western Knights Inn (currently
                                the Best Western Center Pointe Inn) in Branson. One of their sons, Gail, and his wife,
                                MaryAnn, became the managers.

                                    The Myer family focused on the Branson facility adding over 70 new rooms, an indoor
                                    pool, sauna, hot tub, exercise room, game room and converting the onsite restaurant
                                    to a Country Kitchen (now Montana Mike’s Steak House).  With Branson developing into
                                    a top tourism destination, the Myer family committed to the unique town and its
                                    hotel industry. All their hotels in Arkansas were sold and in 1992, the family
                                    opened a new Comfort Inn overlooking the 14th hole of the Thousand Hills Golf
                                    Course. Another of Carroll and Janice’s sons, Chris, became the Assistant Manager of
                                    both the Best Western Center Pointe Inn and the Comfort Inn at Thousand Hills.

                                    The Myer family continued to grow in the industry and opened another hotel in 1993.
                                    The Best Western Music Capital Inn was built on Shepherd of the Hills Expressway
                                    across from the Shoji Tabuchi Theatre. Son Chris Myer became the general manager of
                                    this hotel at the age of 22.

                                    In 1998, they stepped out again and purchased the Cinnamon Inn, also on Shepherd of
                                    the Hills Expressway. The hotel is ideally located as the closest hotel in Branson
                                    to Silver Dollar City and Shepherd of the Hills Homestead. The hotel opened May 1,
                                    1998 and in 1999 underwent a complete renovation with numerous enhancements to
                                    change to a Rodeway Inn. Then in 2002, the property upgraded again to a Comfort Inn.
                                     In 2016 it was repositioned to a Quality Inn after another complete renovation.

                                    Drive, a modern hotel located near Highway 76 in Branson. The Myer family operates

                                    and has developed advanced destination management software. Their restaurant
